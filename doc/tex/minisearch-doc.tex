\section{Overview}
This is the documentation and manual for using MiniSearch. We give
a brief introduction of MiniSearch in Sec.~\ref{sec:intro}.
If you are already familiar with using MiniZinc and want to get a brief
overview of MiniSearch, then head straight to Sec.~\ref{sec:quickStart}
that gives a quick introduction with examples. 

If you are looking for more detailed information on the MiniSearch
language and would like to write your own meta-search approaches with
it, then have a look at Sec.~\ref{sec:minisearch} that describes the 
components of MiniSearch in detail, and check out Sec.~\ref{sec:ownsearch}
that provides a small tutorial on how to write your own meta-search
on a couple of examples.

\section{What is MiniSearch?}
\label{sec:intro}
MiniSearch is a language for specifying {\em meta-search}. Meta-search is any
search approach that aims to find a good (or the best) solution,
such as Branch-and-Bound search (BaB) or Large Neighbourhoud 
Search (LNS). This means that with MiniSearch you can solve your 
MiniZinc model with different kinds of meta-search, such as LNS.

The MiniSearch language is based on MiniZinc, and a MiniSearch
specification is part of the MiniZinc model. MiniSearch also provides
a library of predefined meta-searches that can be directly used.

\section{Quick Start}
\label{sec:quickStart}
\subsection{Using MiniSearch in your MiniZinc model}
How to use MiniSearch is best demonstrated on an example. Consider the MiniZinc model below of the Golomb Ruler Problem.
The Golomb Ruler Problem is concerned with finding a ruler of minimal length with $m$ marks,
where the distances between all marks are different. 
\begin{lstlisting}
% Standard Golomb Ruler model
include "globals.mzn";

int: m;          % number of marks on the ruler
int: n = m*m;    % upper bound for length of ruler

array[1..m] of var 0..n: mark;  % the position of each mark
array[int] of var 0..n: differences =
    [ mark[j] - mark[i] | i in 1..m, j in i+1..m];

constraint mark[1] = 0;
constraint forall ( i in 1..m-1 ) ( mark[i] < mark[i+1] );
constraint alldifferent(differences);
constraint differences[1] < differences[(m*(m-1)) div 2]; % Sym breaking

solve :: int_search(mark, input_order, indomain, complete)%*\label{ex1:solve}*)
    minimize mark[m];

output ["golomb = ", show(mark), "\n"];
\end{lstlisting}
The \mzninline|solve| statement in line~\ref{ex1:solve} states the
objective (minimizing the position of the last mark) and provides 
a CP search strategy annotation\footnote{Note that the CP search strategy is a {\em tree search} strategy and not a meta-search strategy} (\mzninline|int_search|).
This will evoke the solver to solve this problem using the CP search strategy 
(if available), and using its standard approach for minimization (e.g. branch-and-bound for CP solvers).

Now let's extend this model with MiniSearch to solve it with LNS.
%This model can be easily extended with MiniSearch and thereby solved with
%different solving approaches. 
The simplest way is to use the built-in LNS definition that MiniSearch supplies, as in the example below:
\begin{lstlisting}
% Golomb Ruler model with Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS)
include "globals.mzn";
include "minisearch.mzn";%*\label{ex2:library}*)

int: m;          % number of marks on the ruler
int: n = m*m;    % upper bound for length of ruler

array[1..m] of var 0..n: mark;   % the position of each mark
array[int] of var 0..n: differences =
    [ mark[j] - mark[i] | i in 1..m, j in i+1..m];

constraint mark[1] = 0;
constraint forall ( i in 1..m-1 ) ( mark[i] < mark[i+1] );
constraint alldifferent(differences);   
constraint differences[1] < differences[(m*(m-1)) div 2]; % Sym breaking

int: lns_iterations;      %*\label{ex2:constStart}*)
float: destruction_rate;  
int: timeout_ms;          %*\label{ex2:constEnd}*)

solve :: int_search(mark, input_order, indomain, complete)%*\label{ex2:solve}*)
    search lns_min(mark[m], mark, lns_iterations, %*\label{ex2:lns}*)
                   destruction_rate, timeout_ms);

output ["golomb = ", show(mark), "\n"];
\end{lstlisting}

There are two changes in this model.
First, the library \mzninline|minisearch.mzn| is included (line~\ref{ex2:library}). This
is always necessary when using MiniSearch, since it defines all necessary built-ins. 
%This library contains definitions of meta-searches, such as LNS, that can simply be included in the model.
Second, in line~\ref{ex2:lns}, we use the \mzninline|search| keyword
followed by the call to the MiniSearch built-in \mzninline|lns_min|. We declare its constant arguments 
in lines\ref{ex2:constStart}-~\ref{ex2:constEnd}.
The built-in  \mzninline|lns_min| has  the following signature:
\begin{lstlisting}
function ann: lns_min (var int: obj, 
                       array[int] of var int: x,
                       int: iterations, 
                       float: d,
                       int: timeout_ms);
\end{lstlisting}
where \mzninline|obj| is the objective variable that is sought to be minimized,
\mzninline|x| is the array of search variables on which LNS will be performed,
\mzninline|iterations| is the number of LNS iterations, \mzninline|d| is the 
destruction rate, i.e. the percentage of variables in \mzninline|x| that 
should be destroyed (freed) in each LNS iteration, and finally, 
\mzninline|timeout_ms| is the timeout in milliseconds for each 
LNS iteration. Below is a sample data file for the LNS Golomb Ruler model.
\begin{lstlisting}
% Sample data file for Golomb Ruler with LNS
m = 19;                    
lns_iterations = 100;       % 100 LNS iterations
destruction_rate = 0.2;     % 20% destruction rate per iteration
timeout_ms = 6*1000;        % 6 seconds timeout per iteration
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Running MiniSearch in your MiniZinc model}


The simplest way to run your MiniZinc model with MiniSearch
is by using a solver that can take FlatZinc as input, such 
as Gecode, Choco or or-tools. These solvers provide executables
such as \mzninline|fzn-gecode| or \mzninline|fzn_choco|.


\subsubsection{Running MiniSearch with a FlatZinc solver}

If you are using the command line, use the \mzninline|mzn-fzn-lite|
executable and execute it in the following way:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
mzn-fzn-lite --solver <fzn-solver> <my-model.mzn> <my-data.dzn>
\end{lstlisting}
where \mzninline|<fzn-solver>| stands for the FlatZinc
solver (don't forget to add the path if it is not in the PATH), 
\mzninline|<my-model.mzn>| stands for the MiniZinc model that
contains a MiniSearch specification, and \mzninline|<my-data.dzn>|
is the optional data file. As an example, if we write the 
Golomb Ruler model with LNS into the file \mzninline|golomb-lns.mzn|
and write the sample data specification from above into 
\mzninline|golomb.dzn|, and we want to run it on \mzninline|fzn_choco|,
we execute the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
mzn-fzn-lite --solver fzn_choco golomb-lns.mzn golomb.dzn
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Running MiniSearch with an incremental MiniSearch solver}

Solvers can also directly support MiniSearch, by implementing its API.
So far, Gecode supports this option and it is shipped with the distribution
of MiniSearch as the executable \mzninline|mzn-gecode-lite|.

In the command line, it can be executed in the following way:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
mzn-gecode-lite <my-model.mzn> <my-data.dzn>
\end{lstlisting}
