# MiniZinc Changelog #
======================

Version 2.0.2
=============

Changes:
 - The optimiser now removes simple domain constraints from the FlatZinc
 - The compiler now checks for integer overflows in all built-in operations
 - Report an error when the FlatZinc or ozn file cannot be opened for writing
 - Add support for 3d array literals (e.g.  [| |1,2|3,4|,|5,6|7,8| |] )
 - Add show2d and show3d functions for formatting array output
 - Add row/col functions for variable arrays (github issue #2)
 - Introduce builtins for creating random distributions
 - Add reverse library function
 - Postpone flattening of some reified constraints

Bug fixes:
 - Fix simplification of linear expressions, negative coefficients could
   sometimes result in incorrect bounds
 - Fix bounds computation for unary minus operator
 - Add missing par set comparison builtins
 - Fix bounds computation for extended comprehension syntax
 - Fix a bug in the garbage collector that could sometimes lead to premature
   deletion of expressions
 - Fix bounds computation for set difference
 - Fix duplication of some arrays in the FlatZinc (github issue #3)
 - Fix bounds inference for variables bound to empty sets (github bug #3)
 - Fix bug in error reporting function, which would sometimes not report the
   entire call stack
 - Fix the generation of fresh variable names for generator expressions
 - Fix subtype check to allow empty arrays as subtype of arrays of sets
 - Fix crash when using assert/2
 - Fix bug when function used in output referred to par variable
 - Fix bug in type checker, the detection of cyclic definitions was not
   correct and could lead to stack overflows
 - Fix parser to accept expressions with two consecutive array accesses
   (like x[3][4], which are valid MiniZinc if x is an array of sets)
 - Fix error reporting when an evaluation error occurs within a comprehension
   generator
 

Version 2.0.1
=============

Major bugs and changes:
 - Fix optimisation phase, which was previously incorrectly removing variables
 - Add support for trigonometric functions (built-ins were missing in 2.0.0)
   and pow (var versions were missing)
 - Fix equality operator on par arrays
 - All expressions in output model are now made par
 - Improve bounds computation for float variables
 - Fix translation of functions that need automatic coercion of their return
   value
 - Fix the array_lb and array_ub builtins, which would return incorrect bounds
   in some cases

Minor bugs and changes:
 - Add space between "array" and "[" in the pretty printer, to be compatible
   with 1.6 output
 - Output all par declarations before the var declarations in FlatZinc
 - Fix parser, which could sometimes crash on invalid input
 - Improve efficiency of bounds computation on some float expressions
 - Add special case handling for division by 1
 - Add missing float_times definition to the flatzinc builtins
 - Use correct version of var_dom for float variables
 - Output information about which files are included in verbose mode
 - Only compute bounds for "then" expressions if the "if" is not fixed to false

Version 2.0.0
=============

MiniZinc 2.0 contains many new features and is based on a complete rewrite of
the MiniZinc-to-FlatZinc compiler. If you are currently using the previous
version 1.6, the new tools can be used as drop-in replacements. The generated
FlatZinc is compatible with version 1.6, so all FlatZinc solvers should work
without changes.

** MiniZinc language changes **

 - MiniZinc now supports user-defined functions. Details have been published
   in the paper "MiniZinc with Functions". Both functions and predicates can
   be recursive.
 - MiniZinc now supports option types. Details have been published in the
   paper "Modelling with Option Types in MiniZinc".
 - Let expressions have been generalised. They can now contain constraint
   items in addition to variable declarations.
 - Array index sets can be declared using arbitrary set expressions as long as
   they evaluate to contiguous ranges.
 - The if-then-else expression has been generalised to allow the condition to
   be a var bool expression (instead of only par bool).
 - Array and set comprehensions as well as generator calls can now iterate
   over variables and use var bool where conditions.
 - Any bool expression can now automatically coerce to an int expression,
   likewise for int and float. This means that you don't have to write
   bool2int or int2float in you models any more.
 - Equality constraints can now be posted between array expressions.
 - Arbitrary expressions can now be included ("interpolated") into strings,
   using the syntax "some text \(e) some more text", where e is any
   expression. It is the same as writing "some text "++show(e)++" some more
   text".

** New built-in functions **

Array functions: array1d, arrayXd, row, col, has_index, has_element, sort_by,
sort, arg_sort, arg_min, arg_max

** New global constraints **

 - arg_max, arg_min
 - arg_sort
 - k-dimensional diffn
 - disjunctive
 - geost
 - knapsack
 - network_flow
 - regular with NFAs
 - symmetric all different
 - optional scheduling constraints: alternative, span, disjunctive, cumulative
 - functional versions of many global constraints

** New tool chain **

 - There are a few new builtins that solvers can reimplement, these are listed
   in the redefinitions-2.0 file.
 - Include items use a different method for finding included files. Paths are
   now interpreted as relative to the file that has the include item. That
   way, the mzn2fzn compiler can be called from a different working directory.
 - A new tool, mzn2doc, can produce html output from the documentation
   comments. The MiniZinc distribution contains the documentation for global
   constraints and builtins generated directly from the library source code.
