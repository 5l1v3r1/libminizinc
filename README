LibMZN: minizinc 2.0 library and transformation tool

Compilation instructions:
=========================
Prerequisite software:
- cmake
- clang
- bison, flex

To build it, run:
> mkdir build/
> cd build/
> cmake ..
> make

This will create a 'build/' directory and let cmake put its build files there. From then on, it suffices to go into the build directory and run 'make'.
