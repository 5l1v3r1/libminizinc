LibMZN: minizinc 2.0 library and transformation tool

Compilation instructions:
=========================
Prerequisite software:
- cmake
- clang
- bison, flex

To build it, run:
> mkdir build/
> cd build/
> cmake ..
> make

This will create a 'build/' directory and let cmake put its build files there. From then on, it suffices to go into the build directory and run 'make'.

Running
=======
Usage:
> ./build/mzn2fzn model.mzn data.dzn

Run 'mzn2fzn' without arguments to see all options.

If you get the error "Error: cannot open file 'builtins.mzn'" then you did not execute mzn2fzn in the root folder (probably in build/ instead). Change directory to the (root) folder containing 'builtins.mzn' and try again.
