MiniZinc 2.0 beta release
=========================

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

These instructions are for compiling and installing MiniZinc 2.0 beta from the
source distribution.

MiniZinc 2.0 beta is based on the libminizinc C++ library. In order
to compile and install libminizinc you will need the following
software:

Compilation instructions:
-------------------------

Prerequisite software:
- cmake
- A recent C++ compiler, libminizinc has been tested with recent versions of
  clang, g++, and Microsoft Visual C++.
- The bison and flex parser/lexer generators. These usually come packaged for
  Linux distributions, and they are part of the Xcode developer tools for Mac
  OS. On Windows, you can e.g. install them via cygwin.

Download the source code from the git repository or uncompress a source
archive. Then change into the toplevel directory (the one containing this file).

To build it on Linux or other Unix-like systems:
> mkdir build
> cd build/
> cmake ..
> make

To build it on Windows:
Open a Visual Studio console (e.g. from the Start menu), then
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> nmake


Running
-------

Add the "build" directory to your PATH
environment variable. In addition, you need to set the MZN_STDLIB_DIR
environment variable to the directory "share/minizinc" inside the source tree.

The build directory contains the 2.0 beta versions of the mzn2fzn and
solns2out tools. These are drop-in replacements for the MiniZinc 1.6 versions.

We currently do not provide the minizinc driver program that was part
of MiniZinc 1.6. However, if you have both systems installed (and MiniZinc 2.0
occurs on the PATH before 1.6), you can use the old minizinc driver
with the new versions of mzn2fzn and solns2out.

Alternatives:
 - copy the two executables mzn2fzn and solns2out to somewhere on your PATH 
   instead of setting your PATH
 - add the command line option --stdlib-dir=MINIZINC/share/minizinc (where 
   you replace MINIZINC by the actual path mentioned above)
