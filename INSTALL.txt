in your file system.

If you are compiling from the sources, please see the INSTALL.txt document.

Compilation instructions:
-------------------------

Prerequisite software:
- cmake
- clang, gcc or Microsoft Visual C++
- bison, flex (can be installed e.g. with Cygwin)

Download the source code from the git repository or uncompress a source
archive. Then change into the toplevel directory (the one containing this file).

To build it on Linux or other Unix-like systems:
> mkdir build
> cd build/
> cmake ..
> make

To build it on Windows:
Open a Visual Studio console (e.g. from the Start menu), then
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
> nmake


Running
-------

IF YOU INSTALLED A BINARY PACKAGE, add the "bin" directory inside that package
to your PATH environment variable. In addition, you need to set the
MZN_STDLIB_DIR environment variable to the directory "share/minizinc" inside
package directory.

IF YOU COMPILED FROM SOURCES, add the "build" directory to your PATH
environment variable. In addition, you need to set the MZN_STDLIB_DIR
environment variable to the directory "share/minizinc" inside the source tree.

Alternatives:
 - copy the two executables mzn2fzn and solns2out to somewhere on your PATH 
   instead of setting your PATH
 - add the command line option --stdlib-dir=MINIZINC/share/minizinc (where 
   you replace MINIZINC by the actual path mentioned above)
